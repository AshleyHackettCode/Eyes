# Eyes

DESCRIPTION:

This project uses vanilla JavaScript with 'onmousemove' event to trigger with the mouse moving on the window to move the "pupils" around the eyes.

How to run:

Clone the repository into your local environment

Open the index.html file

Right click and select 'Open Default browser' to open the project in your default browser.

Roadmap of future improvements

Possibly making this a smaller face and more towards animated objects with different events allowed to allow different interactions like jump, walk, and change color.

This is a fun eye moving project that showcases my expanding knowledge. 
Enjoy!
